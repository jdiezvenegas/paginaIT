# About EESTEC
EESTEC is an apolitical, non-governmental and non-profit organization for students,
institutes and schools of technology. The name come from Electrical Engineering STudents
European assoCiation.

It offers the opportunity to the students for developing their ideas through workshops,
exchanges and local projects such as this page.

By the way electronics keep improving, a need have been growning all the time: 
associate electronics students. In Berlin, by the end of the year 1964, the first attempt
to found an organization was made and it success along 1965. Eurielec was born.
In spite of the support of Dutch industry, Eurielec was dissolved in 1972.

In 1984, three students decided to reignite the project reneweing the international student
activities. They invited all Eurielec members to facilitate the creation of EESTIC
(Electrical Engineering STudents International Conference).

The inaugural gathering was held in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, between April 27 and May 3,
1986, and was attended by 50 students from 33 different cities in 17 different countries.
The last day is considered to be the founding of EESTEC and introduced the current structure
and the concept of NatComs (National Committees) as first contact for each country.

In Nova Gorica and Ljubljana, was celebrated the second congress in 1987. This year began
a lot of initiatives and current logo was designed. Also, There have been two workshops,
Vienna (november) and Madrid (december)

EESTEC was able to hold the status for years, and even evolving, for example, in 1995, the 
official seat was moce from Budapest to Zurich to facilitate financial transactions. Also,
NatComs were eliminated, giving each LC (Local Comittee) direct representation at the EESTEC
activities. Congress kept celebrating and EESTEC was considered as a consolidated organization.

# About LC Madrid

LC Madrid is one of the committees which founded EESTEC back in the 80s, being a former 
member of the old association which lead to the formation of EESTEC: Eurielec. Since we 
are very lazy, we have kept this old name, Eurielec, for decades, and it has become now 
part of our identity. We are located at the Telecommunication School of the Technical 
University of Madrid (ETSIT UPM), and so far, we are the only LC in Spain. At local level,
we work on different Electrical Engineering and Computer Science projects, such as the
organisation of Linux and open software courses or the organisation of small workshops in
electronics projects. We also work in projects about soft skills, working and travelling
in Europe. Recently, we have tended to be very involved in EESTEC at international level.

## Projects
Some projects are listed here:

### Workshop
During a week, a topic about the latest technology is treated for more than 16 hours splitted
by sessions, conferences, etc. There are some special guest such as leading enterprises,
proffesors. Also, 4 hours are spent  to take care of relevant soft skills for supporting the
topic.

### SSA
SSA is the way to higlight yourself against laboral competitors. The soft skills are
abilities which allow people develope personally. This improvment enables us to make 
the most of ourselves. Examples can be leadership, design thinking, team work, etc.

### Exchanges
Meet new people around Europe thanks to EESTEC. Know new cultures and people thanks to
our presence in 25 countries and 52 Local Comittees.

### Motivational day
We think our core is the people who makes up LC Madrid so, one of the most valuated events
is Motivational Days, where we eat together and have fun.

### Congress
As Local Comittee (LC), we are involucrated in EESTEC international, which defines the future
of our lovely association. They are the most important events of the year and are celebrated 
twice a year, trying to get the highest number of participants of each LC.

### IMW
International version of motivational days. For two days, all Europe LC´s are guessed to 
Madrid and we push to the limit the Motivational Day philosophy. Teambuilding and teambounding
are pretended to reach the best relationship with other international teams.

## IT

LC Madrid are a conglomerate of teams. IT is one of these. IT team holds the technic aspect of LC Madrid. One of the most important event is the
Linux Curse, where we teach Linux and the principes which hold the open-source philosphy.
Also LC Madrid relay on us the responsability to develop all webs and other necessary 
services to manage all other events.


# About me

I´m Jacobo Díez Venegas, an ETSIT engineering student. This year, I´m going be the 
IT vocal with other members. This year comes full of projects and challenges which 
are pretended to be passed with team working. Our projects will be released here,
as posts. This page also can be useful to next year IT members, to have more facilities
about deploying web pages. If you want to contact me, you can use the links above, in the
